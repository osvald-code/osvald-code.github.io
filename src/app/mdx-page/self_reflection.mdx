What are my core values and beliefs?
**Values:**
- Give everyone a base amount of love and respect 
- Honesty is a better social investment than dishonesty
- Enjoying life is more important than accumulating wealth 
- Help others if you can
**Meta-beliefs:**
- All things I think I know are subject to change 
- There is no guarantee that anything will stay the same, or that anything will change. However, somethings have never changed and somethings always do.
- Deeper truth is found through questioning everything, even the things you already think you know
- All things are probably beyond a binary true or false 
 **World-beliefs:**
- Everything anyone knows in life is just a series of beliefs
- Every living thing is born into the world subject to a series of laws
- Every person is living life through their own lens and story, and everyone else is just another character who mostly disappears when off screen 
- While most people have more potential to learn than they realize/accept, not everyone is capable of learning all things, and that's okay
- Most people have a helpful selection of knowledge on something
**Technology
- Digital spaces are 'real', just not physical 
- Having instant messaging doesnt obligate instant replying
- phone notifications are thought-injections : choose them responsibly
- society needs to differentiate between online generated anxiety and physical world anxiety 
- current social media models incentivize people to mask content generation as social interaction, especially conflict
